TDD(TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT)
*before writing the code we write the test.
*we have to write the code to pass those test cases.
*methods will be there but without code inside it.
BDD(Behavioural deiven development)
*Cucumber
*user friendly comments in the test code.which is the scenario
*client will mention the  scenarios and we have to write the code based on those scenarios.
METHOD REFERENCE
simplified way of writing lamda expression
*can't do it in every lamda exprn.
To simplify lambda expression.
Very much limited
Filter(s->s.length()>=5 ).foreach(System.out::println)
Short cut way of writing lambda expresion
We can onlyÂ  in scenario where we have to print the lambda object directly(s)
