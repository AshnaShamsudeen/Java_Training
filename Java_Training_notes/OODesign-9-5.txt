Object Oriented Design
----------------------

Cobol-->C-->OOPlang-->OODesign

->UML(Unified Modelling Language)
Related to class:-
	*Abstraction
	*Encapsulation
	*Decomposition
	*Generalisation

class StudentGrade{

private	double grade;
public void setGrade(double grade){
	if(grade<=5){
		this.grade=grade;
	}
	.....
}
} sg.setGrade(9)


*in class
"-" denotes private
"+" denotes public



eg:-

Car                                Name

-color                             Properties
-model  

+setColor(color:String)
+getColor():  String               Methods  

Decomposition
Association
-----------
*somehow the are related but they also can individually exist.
*Where boh the object can exist individually
eg:Flight and Passengers
---Fridge and Fruits

"________ " single line is used to denote association .   

Aggregation
------------
*It is a "Has-A" relationship where one object is dependent on the other
eg:Flight and Crew-Member
"<>--------" denotes agregation.
Composition
-----------
It is a strong "Has-A" relationship where both object are dependant on each other and no one can exists individually
eg:Person and Brain
--Car and Engine
--Employee and Salary



Generalisation
--------------
Animal
#color
#size
+speak()
Cat
speak(){
sout("meow...");
}
Dog
speak(){
sout("bark...");
}
