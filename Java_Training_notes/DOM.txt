DOM MANIPULATION
------------------
Document Object Model

*inner html is for container text.
eg:<p></p>
*value is for text other than container text.
eg:<input>

*don't use function keyword,let,constant inside a class

ARROW fUNCTION
----------------

*similar to lamda fn.
*we can reduce the code.
*no need to use return
*can use where we are combining modern fn with arrays.

CALLBACK
````````
PASSING A FN.TO ANOTHER FUNCTION.
*A(B)
	:A CAN CALL B WHENEVER IT WANTS.


PROMISE
-------
*has 2 methods
:-can either Reject or Resolve(GET REJECTED OR RESOLVED)
Stages:-PENDING
	FULFILLED
	REJECTED
*uotput of an asynchronous operation
*if you have to check something we can use then
*inside catch we can mention the aftereffect of then.
*things inside finally will execute irrespective of then and catch
*concept similar to error handling in java



Async and Await
---------------

*if you write async(asynchronous) in front of any fn.then it will return some promise.
eg:-
	const callMe=async function(){
	........................
	}

*await =>you are writing for an async fn. to get completed(resolved/rejected)
