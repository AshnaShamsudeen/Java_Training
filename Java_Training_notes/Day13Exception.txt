Exception Handling
----------------------
1.Syntax Error/Compile time error
2.Run time Error-->Exception error(*an error that occur during runTime)
	Eg:null pointer exception
3.Logical Error
*when ecxeption program stops at that point.
Exception handling
------------------
how to recover from a exception or how to deal with the  ecxeption

*in every scenario we can't avoid ecxeption simply.so java provides:
		1.try-write the code that can lead to some exception
 		2.catch:-write what to be done if the exception occured
 		3.finally:-a code block to be executed irrespective of whether or not the exception occured.

EXCEPTION ARE OF TWO TYPES
---------------------------
1.checked exception/Compile time exception
certain scenario writing exception handling is compulsory ie,we must have to write try-catch
*which are checked at compile time
2.unchecked Exception/Run time exception
which are checked at run time


All checked exception extends the exception class directl

eg:-FileNotFoundException
SQLException,ioException,ClassNotFoundException
All unchecked exception extends the exception  run time class 

eg:
ArithemeticException,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException,NullPointerException,InputMismatchException,NumberFormatException
