java 8 features
----------------

1.default and static methods in interface.(interface with body)
2.Functional interface & Lambda Expression
3.Stream API
4.Collection API improvements.
5.Date & Time improvements.
  
lamda expression is only possible for single abstract method which is called functional inteface


*what is functional interface?
	An abstract consisting of single abstract method.
*Lambda expression?
 	Lambda expressionare the implementation of functional interface.
*-> denotes Lambda expression
*we can create static and default methods in functional interface but can't create more than 1 abstract method.
*default?
	default interface can have methods with body

Stream API:
	filter:filter the data based on certain condn(intermidiate method )-->will return another stream
	map:changes the values(intermediate method)
	reduce:reduce the entire stream to a single value(termination method)-->will return an integer value not stream, we can't do map or filter after this 
										ie,it terminates.


Comparable :
	solved by using comparator
