ER Model/Entity Relationship Diagram
-------------------------------------
*Entity relationship diagram helps to know the relations b/w diff.entity

*entity:
	It is an object of interest.It have some attributes
	*Every entity represent a table in DB.
		eg:Students;which has name,id etc. as attributes. 
*SQL doesn't support the concept of multivalued attribute
*Weak entity which has no primary key

*Attributes:
	*Property of entity called attributes
*Relationship:
	*One to One,One to many,many to one,One or many,zero or Many

	     |
	    (n)
             |
           Teach(many to one)
	     |
	    (1)
